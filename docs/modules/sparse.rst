Warp includes a sparse linear algebra module ``warp.sparse`` that implements some common operations for manipulating sparse matrices that arise in simulation.

Sparse Matrices
-------------------------

Currently `warp.sparse` supports Block Sparse Row (BSR) matrices, the BSR format can also be used to represent Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrices as a special case with a 1x1 block size.
